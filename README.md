# Overview
Quick util page to check if a undirected graph has a hamiltonian path. You can paste an adjacency matrix and get a quick dfs check (or various other algos). 

## Usage
- Feed an adjaceny matrix in, get a yes or no result.
- Feed an csv file in of a adjaceny matrix in, get a yes or no result.
- Draw a graph, get a yes or no result.

### Adjaceny Matrix
Wut is it? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix

Input formated as follows: 

<code>1,0,0,0
0,1,0,0
0,0,1,0
0,0,0,1
</code>

### CSV File
Wut is it? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)

A matrix in adjaceny format can be stored in csv and input via input csv file button.


## Why does this exist
- I wanted a quick free visual tool to play around with graphs and quickly verify.
- I wanted something an ml web agent could easily use to test algorithims. 

## TODOs and Ideas
- Maybe render the path on input submission? (for now not going to do this but might revist)
